Original Prompt: For the oritional prompt, I wanted a simple 10x10 battleship game with 3 ships. The ships are randomly placed, and the user wins when they destroy all 3 ships.


1st Iteration: For the first iteration, I focused on creating a new grid so that the AI and user can compete against eachother. The AI would select a random position on the grid and fire.


2nd Iteration: For this iteration, I focused on making the AI smarter so that it uses a hunt and target mode. I also added persistent local storage to the game so that it can maintain its state during refreshes.


Currently there are no known limitations of the most recent iteration of the game, but I will update this if any new information is found.
